    "CliXO is an algorithm that is supposed to build an ontology/hierarchy of objects (see Kramer et al, Bioinformatics, 2014) taken a weighted network, in which the edge weights represent the similarity between objects. However, the original algorithm (https://github.com/mhk7/clixo_0.3) has several defects, and generates hierarchical model with undesired artefacts. We have redesigned the algorithm, which we call CliXO 2 here, and the algorithm has notable improvements in carefully conducted benchmarks. Here we report the results.  "
